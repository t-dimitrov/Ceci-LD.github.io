								<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom:1em">Hi! I'm Tsvetelin, a game programmer and a software engineer from Bulgaria, and I've been making games since 13 and playing games from an even younger age. I published my first mobile game on Google Play in August, 2019. I have finished Software Engineering Bachelor program at <a href="https://en.via.dk/">VIA University College</a> in Denmark, and currently I am developing my second game "Split Brain" since late August, 2019</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom:2em"><a href="#projects"><strong>Here</strong></a> you can see some of the projects I have had the opportunity to contribute to, and some personal projects that I have created myself.</p>
								<h3 class="major" style="margin-bottom: 1em">Personal Information</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom:2em">Since I was 9 years old I have never lived in a single country more than 2 consecutive years. I was born in Serbia, although my parents are Bulgarian, and have lived in Bulgaria, South Africa, The United States, Greece, Denmark, Jordan, and Austria. This has taught me to constantly adapt to changes and has led me to become more open minded and empathetic.</p>
								<h3 class="major" style="margin-bottom: 1em">Interests</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Playing 2D platformers, real-time strategy, and ﬁghting video games</li>
									<li>Playing Basketball</li>
									<li>Watching Science-Fiction movies</li>
									<li>Creating soundtracks</li>

								<p style="text-align: justify">I currently do not have any professional experience besides my internship during the 5th semester of my Bachelor program at <a href="https://en.via.dk/">VIA University College</a>.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify">I had an opportunity to begin working for a software engineering company after my internship, but decided to focus on game development and work on personal project, as I did not believe that I was competent enough.
																Since then, I have been reading a lot of books regarding algorithms and machine learning, and have created a few personal projects which reflect my knowledge.</p>
								<h3>Internship</h3>
								<ul class="alt">
									<li><strong>Position: </strong> Software Engineering Intern</li>
									<li><strong>Company: </strong> SevenGate LLC.</li>
									<li><strong>Place: </strong> Amman, Jordan</li>
									<li><strong>Period: </strong> July, 2018 - December, 2018</li>
								</ul>
								<p style = "text-align: justify"> VIA University College allows Software Engineering students to take an internship during their 5th semester, which is why I took the opportunity to move and work in Amman, Jordan.<br>During my internship I was in charge with executing delegated tasks from customers on time and with a high quality. I mainly focused on network security and internet protocols. I completed the internship training early and ahead of time, but decided to extend my training period for one more month. Throughout this period, I received two Sophos XG Firewall certiﬁcates, which can be found below.</p>

								Tale of the Ocean World is an endless runner game with pixel art graphics. It was targeted towards a young audience to teach them about marine pollution and the harm it inflicts on marine wildlife.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								I used Unity3D and C# to create all the scripts and game logic, while drawing all of the assets in Aseprite. Throughout the development of the game I learned a lot about Scriptable Objects as many of the components needed to be created as such. Below is an example of the PowerUp scriptable object used in order to create all of the different power ups in the game.

							<p style="text-align: justify">I have studied algorithms and data structures in my 3rd semester, but as time passes knowledge seems to get forgotten. Instead of creating such algorithms to use in individual projects, programmers tend to use pre-existing libraries with these algorithms already implemented. When I started learning JavaScript, I wanted to make sure I haven't forgotten about these algorithms and applied them in a small project. </p>
							<p>I have implemented three sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, heap sort, and quick sort. The application starts with one unsorted array and depending on the algorithm you choose to use, the array will begin to visually get sorted.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/boxJump.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p style="text-align: justify">My first journey into machine learning did not begin with this project. I took a machine learning course during the 6th semester of my Bachelor studies, learning much of the basics and theory for creating neural networks, and using algorithms for the different types of machine "learning". I decided to venture off deeper into the subject and create my own AI that can tackle problems. Initially I started recreating Flappy Bird using the NEAT algorithm, but encountered countless of obstacles until the whole project was rendered useless and unable to work in any way. I messed up big time, but came out with a better understanding of the subject.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">Box jump is a simple 2D game where the player/AI has to jump over incoming boxes. The boxes have a random chance to spawn in one of four different positions. After the initial stage was complete and the player could move and avoid obstacles, it was time to implement the AI.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">The first task was to create the input layer from the box to the neural network. There are total of 7 inputs: x and y position of the player box and the closest enemy box, distance between the closest enemy box and the player box. The hardest part was creating the population and visualizing each individual box. After the connections were done I implemented a small function to change between training the boxes and showing the best box so far.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify">After seeing the 1986 flocking simulation, I decided to read Craig Reynolds' (the inventor) background regarding the Boids. Thereafter I wanted to recreate it by just following the three rules: Alignment, Cohesion and Separation.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">I decided to use JavaScript, because of its simplicity, and p5.js for its easy setup and visualizations. When creating the project, I decided to add a bit more physics to the algorithm, therefore I applied mass to each boid, and having the steering of that boid a bit harder due to its mass. This made the smaller boids more agile, while the larger boids very bulky.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">The images below are code snippets showcasing the behavior of each rule (mentioned above) that every boid follows.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/separation.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p style="text-align: justify">I am aware of the time complexity of this project, and there are many more efficient ways of improving it. One way I could think of is to put the boids in a tree so we can iterate through them faster if there are close to the main boid</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify">After reading the "Introduction to algorithms", by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. I wanted to expand my knowledge regarding algorithms. I wanted to recreate the minimum spanning tree in a more interactable way, and then allow the user to choose a starting and ending point, and apply a path finding algorithm to the tree. </p>
							<p>I have only implemented the A* algorithm (although not really worth it for this project), which I had a lot of troubles with. I learned a lot by trying to implemented my theoretical knowledge to practice, and I recommend anyone else who wants to learn algorithms to try and implement the algorithms that they find interesting.</p>
							<p>You can see a snippet of the implementation for the A* algorithm below, and more precisely the formula.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/A_star.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I had to apply a heuristics function to the algorithm, and I chose the raw euclidean distance instead of the manhattan distance for example.</p>
